00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,279
Laura:
...years ago.

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,615
(indistinct arguing)

4
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,783
Max: That's it!

00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,077
♪ ♪

00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,874
(inaudible)

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,459
You understand!

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,669
I know you do!

9
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,594
Laura:
Ohh!

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,738

(vehicle approaching)

13
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,673
Hey, kiddo.

14
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,138
Laura: I feel as if
I've stepped into a,

15
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,723
a time machine.

16
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,516
(dry chuckle)

17
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,059
Oh, my God,

18
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,519
is that a Steenbeck?

19
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,230
Arthur: The perks
of being a drop-out.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,775
I can just do
what I do, my way.

21
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,193
It's nice.

22
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,321
I don't think
in all these years

23
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,948
that I've told you, but...

24
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,784
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,537
No, Laura,
it was my fault,

26
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,664
not yours.

27
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,542
After what happened,

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,003
I needed to leave
the company.

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,340
Besides, it was
almost 30 years ago.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,217
I kept up with your work,
you know.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,387
The superheroes in space

32
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,766
with the fourth
dimensional explosions.

33
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,851
New tools.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,188
That's all that is. CGI.

35
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,814
I think you
would have loved it

36
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,107
if you gave it a shot.

37
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,778
I needed something real
to hold on to.

38
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,950
Uh, the service was nice.

39
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,381
Laura, you're here
for a reason, aren't you?

40
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,844
These were always
my favorite.

41
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,598
I don't know
how you do it,

42
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,853
capture a soul
with latex and paint.

43
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,901
Do you think it's possible

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,570
to be forgiven by the dead?

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,366
Arthur:
No. I tried for 30 years.

46
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,619
The best we can do
is forgive ourselves.

47
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,838
Max and I
were getting divorced.

48
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,426
Well, I haven't spoken
to him for years. I'm sorry.

49
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,344
We were still partners
at work.

50
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,263
We kept the facade,

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
but at home,

52
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,434
things had gotten
really bad.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,477
On the day he died,
I asked him to come

54
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,604
and see me to talk through
some of the final things

55
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,647
in the divorce agreement.

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,442
One thing led to another,
and I...

57
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,444
I started a fight.

58
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,945
It was
the same old fight.

59
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,447
Sing it again.

60
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,824
But this time,

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,951
something broke.

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,454
He ran outside
from the house,

63
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,081
and he turned
and looked at me

64
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,499
one last time...

65
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,381
and jumped.

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,051
Oh, Jesus.

67
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,386
Before he went
over the edge,

68
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,430
his eyes...

69
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,476
Arthur...

70
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,605
I came here
to hire you.

71
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,191
No. No.
(sniffles)

72
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,817
I came here
to beg you.

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,571
I need you to make me
one of your maquettes of Max.

74
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,324
I need to look
into his eyes

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,826
and beg the forgiveness
of a ghost.

76
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,454
And maybe he'll forgive me
and maybe he won't.

77
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,083
Maybe I'm damned
to follow him over that cliff.

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,626
But I need to know.

79
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,253
That's why I'm here.

80
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,839
(kettle whistling)

81
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,720
You can say it.

82
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,683
I've lost it.
I, I must sound nuts.

83
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,644
Grief is
a strange creature.

84
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,312
I just can't let that be
the last time

85
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,480
that I see his face.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,606
I need to apologize.

87
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,650
I need to beg
his forgiveness.

88
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,693
And you're the only one

89
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,277
who can bring him
back for me.

90
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,363
You are the only one
who can understand.

91
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,490
I know you do.

92
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,701
You would do
the same thing.

93
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,914
(classical music playing)

94
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,752
(leaves rustling)

95
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,007
(doorbell rings)

96
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,860
(latch clicks)

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,796
Max.

98
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,009
Oh, Max, I'm...

99
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,012
I'm so sorry.

100
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,815
My God, Laura!

101
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,610
My God!

102
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,863
-How could you?
-It was 40 years ago.

103
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,201
If I could undo it,
I would.

104
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,495
But it's done.

105
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,997
We're here and now.

106
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,875
Forget that you saw it.

107
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,628
And let it go.

108
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,754
Max:
Laura, I can't.

109
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,340
I can't lie about this.

110
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,218
I came here to tell you that I'm going
to take the footage to the police.

111
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,472
-Please.
-No!

112
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,182
No, there's no other way.

113
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,976
I've made up my mind.

114
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,019
(Laura sighs)

115
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,982
(kettle whistling)

116
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,025
Okay.

117
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,027
Just...

118
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,572
(whistling continues)

119
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,865
Just hold on.

120
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,039
(pouring tea)

121
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,213
Thank you.

122
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,763
Has, has anyone else
seen the footage?

123
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,349
No one else but me.

124
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,227
I wanted to tell you first
before I went to the police.

125
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,105
I owe you that.

126
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,523
Thank you.

127
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,776
I think you should
tell Arthur. Tonight.

128
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,070
I think he would want
to hear it from you.

129
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,573
Before all this comes out.

130
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,077
Max, you're right.

131
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,706
All of this is right.

132
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,959
And now that
I have accepted it,

133
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,880
it's like a weight has been
lifted from my shoulders.

134
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,382
Thank you for being strong
for both of us.

135
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,092
(soft chuckle)

136
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,806
Max:
I, I can't feel my hands.

137
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,437
What did you do?

138
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,855
It's already
in your system.

139
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,566
In, in a few minutes,
your heart will start to slow.

140
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,737
It will be painless.
Just like falling asleep.

141
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,406
(grunting)

142
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,742
Max, there's nothing
that you can do.

143
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,660
Just let it happen.

144
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,039
You're insane.

145
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,833
The footage is locked
on my drive, Laura.

146
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,504
You can't get to it.

147
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,340
I have all
of your passwords.

148
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,636
I'll delete the file
and burn the original film.

149
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,013
This is everything, Max.

150
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,099
This is everything
that is mine.

151
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,184
And I, I can't let you
take it.

152
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,775
Max! Max!

153
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,236
You understand!

154
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,821
I know you do!

155
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,660
You would do
the same thing.

156
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,705
Look into my eyes, Laura.

157
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
Remember this.

158
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,045
Ohh!

159
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,797
Oh, my God.

160
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,843
(dramatic orchestral
music playing)

161
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,365
(sniffles)

162
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,038
(beeps)

163
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,093
Oh shit.

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,151
(beeps)

165
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,235
(laughs)

166
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,406
Thank you.

167
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,207
(phone ringing)

168
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,167
MAN: (over phone)
LAM Archives.

169
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,502
Raoul.

170
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,212
How you doing?
It's Laura.

171
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,923
I need you to pull some film for me
and bring it to the house.

172
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,093
It's from the "Dragonfish"
behind-the-scenes shoot

173
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,511
in the '80s.

174
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:04,349
It's reel number
1-6-6-3-2-4-6.

175
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,080
-Barber: How's the family?
-Man: Doing great.

176
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,332
Johnny's getting
honor roll this semester.

177
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,042
-How's the shop?
-Barber: Never better.

178
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,627
Man:
That's fantastic.

179
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,212
-How's the new job?
-Terrific.

180
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,673
I like my coworkers.
It pays the bills.

181
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,258
-Barber 2: That's wonderful.
-Man 3: Sure.

182
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,678
It's a bit of an adjustment,
but I'm loving married life.

183
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
-Barber 4: How's it look?
-Man 4: Great.

184
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,889
Best cut ever.

185
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,183
Oh, my God,
the mountainous volume,

186
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,853
the sheer metric tonnage
of bullshit in this place,

187
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,188
every word,
I swear to God.

188
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,482
I think maybe I'm getting
more sensitive or something.

189
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,152
I'm developing an eye twitch.
Can you see that?

190
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,572
-Yeah.
-Charlie: Yeah.

191
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,573
How do you handle it?

192
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,825
It's a barbershop.

193
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,702
Hey, I need you
to deliver this

194
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,662
to 52 Cherokee.

195
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,748
Old farmhouse
just outside of town.

196
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,124
Extra little for you.

197
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,334
Ah!

198
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,128
-What's in it?
-What do you think?

199
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:15,837
Right.

200
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,339
In the case

201
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,090
of a one-year-old Yamir.

202
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,508
Charlie:
Not the father.

203
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,385
(doorbell dings)

204
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,595
You are not the father!

205
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,347
(audience cheering)

206
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,432
Every time.

Oh, hi.

219
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,434
I got your bag of hair
from the, uh,

220
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,769
the barbershop.

221
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,521
Ah, right.

222
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,981
Right.

223
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,192
Right, right. Uh...

224
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,861
Hair.

225
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,947
You're welcome.

226
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,201
Uh... so, uh...

227
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,329
no need
for an explanation.

228
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,748
I, uh...

229
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,502
I'm Charlie, by the way.
Uh, Charlie Cale.

230
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,838
-Arthur.
-Hey, Arthur.

231
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,174
So, uh,
just leave it, uh...

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,176
leave it here?

233
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,261
Perfect.

234
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,389
Too easy.

235
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,438
Hey, man, uh, listen,
I'm gettin' the vibe

236
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,189
you want to be left alone,
and, and I really,

237
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,359
I respect that, so I apologize
in advance, but...

238
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,278
well, with the hair
and the, uh...

239
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,531
the monster
in the window,

240
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,741
consider my interest piqued.

241
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,368
So, uh, what do you do?

242
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,913
Charlie, usually,
I, I like to talk

243
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,331
about what I do.

244
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:21,296
But today, I just buried
an old friend.

245
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,882
So right now,
all I feel like

246
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,259
is getting shitfaced.

247
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,138
My eye's not twitching.

248
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,141
Uh...

249
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,934
which is to say,
that's the first honest thing

250
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,686
I've heard all week.

251
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,813
Uh, and I'm sorry
for your loss.

252
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,398
Hey, listen, I,

253
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,233
I didn't know what kind
of a griever you are,

254
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,988
but if having
some company helps,

255
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,367
I, uh, I'm in no rush
to get back to work.

256
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,079
Sit, leave,
doesn't matter to me.

257
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,082
That blessed honesty.

258
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,001
Gotta say it's
manna from heaven.

259
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,046
Ah!

260
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,508
(soft chuckle)

261
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,053
Mm.

262
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,681
That one stung, Arthur.

263
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,307
(both laugh)

264
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,314
Arthur:
So when I blew smoke out,

265
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,024
it was supposed
to go out the trunk,

266
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,943
it didn't,
it went out the ass.

267
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,780
And it covers the first
three rows of people.

268
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,323
They split.

269
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,533
(laughs)

270
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,368
Everybody else gets out.

271
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,291
Ahh.

272
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,501
Hello.

273
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,045
Art. Jesus.

274
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,966
You are a cool,
cool dude, man.

275
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,468
God, this is
a major relief,

276
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,471
because with the hair
and everything,

277
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,890
I thought maybe you were
potentially some kind

278
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,183
of a serial killer.

279
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,269
Well, if I was
a serial killer,

280
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,937
I wouldn't need hair.

281
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,480
I'd already have hair.

282
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,818
Well, you could be
a serial killer of the bald.

283
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,194
-Aha.
-(Arthur laughs)

284
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,988
Should I call you
a cab?

285
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,823
I got the Cuda.
I got the car.

286
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,324
So I'm all set.

287
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,993
You're not going to drive.

288
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,995
No, no.
To sleep in.

289
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,205
You know, there's a cot
right up there.

290
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,291
You could
crash here tonight.

291
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,501
Oh, that's not scary at all.

292
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,586
That's great.

293
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,756
Yeah.

294
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,132
Jesus.

295
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,551
Monsters,
monsters, monsters.

296
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,553
Wow, wow.

297
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,513
Holy cow.

298
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,060
All this comes
from inside your head?

299
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,646
I mean, it must be
a horror show in there.

300
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,025
Hell, you got
no idea, kid.

301
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,943
Monsters.

302
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,196
Screams from the void.

303
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,782
Void screams?

304
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,700
-Yeah.
-Very heavy.

305
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,827
Alright,
So I'm standing

306
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,246
and I'm looking
and I'm thinking.

307
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,874
And so, feel free
to say it's a no-go,

308
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,335
but do you need
an assistant?

309
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,712
Now, before you answer that,
I should warn you

310
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,297
that I only accept cash,

311
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,675
and you can feel free
to underpay me.

312
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,801
Well...

313
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,470
why not?

314
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,889
Welcome to
the House of Horrors,

315
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,265
Charlie Cale.

316
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,562
Alright.

317
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,109
(dramatic music playing)

318
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,909
Mamma mia.

319
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,577
Don't touch those.

320
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,995
Oh. Yeah, sorry, I just,

321
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,581
I see you working on it
all the time, I got curious.

322
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,584
So, uh, what's it, uh,
what's it going to be?

323
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,671
I'm calling it
The Orpheus Syndrome.

324
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,256
Oh yeah?
What's it about?

325
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,799
It's a non-narrative.

326
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,596
Oh, uh, you want some
of this jelly toast?

327
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,640
-It's freaking delicious.
-You bought jelly?

328
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,893
Mm, no. It's, uh, you had some
of it in your fridge.

329
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,353
You know,
that's fake blood.

330
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,313
Do you know how
expensive that stuff is?

331
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,733
That costs more
than real blood.

332
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,361
Arterialicious.

333
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,989
Oh shit.

334
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,949
-Fuck, Arthur. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

335
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,035
Don't worry.
I'll take care of that.

336
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,661
-You hang this...
-Yeah. Okay.

337
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,912
...on the film bin.

338
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,788
Charlie:
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,914
Arthur:
That's alright.

340
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,504
(vehicle approaching)

341
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,092
Laura: Arthur,
I need you to make me

342
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,595
one of your maquettes
of Max.

343
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,056
I need to look
into his eyes

344
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,515
and beg forgiveness
from a ghost.

345
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,185
And maybe he'll forgive me
and maybe he won't.

346
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,730
Maybe I'm damned to follow him
over that cliff.

347
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,190
But I need to know.

348
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,193
That's why I'm here.

349
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,655
(kettle whistling)

350
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:07,999
Are you okay?

351
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,918
We got a new job.

352
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm going to need
you full time

353
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,506
for a few weeks.

354
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,261
(sighs)
Hey, uh, look, uh...

355
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,389
I know this is weird,

356
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,685
but, uh, whatever
that lady asked you for,

357
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,854
whatever she told you
she was here for,

358
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,022
she wasn't.

359
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,482
Okay?
She was lying.

360
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,234
I could tell.

361
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,028
Oh.

362
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,113
Snoop.

363
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,365
(chuckles)

364
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,326
I, I don't know
what lies mean

365
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,829
when you're
that deep in grief.

366
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,332
She's a friend.

367
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,543
I gonna help her.

368
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,296
Let's get to work.

369
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,259
So to help
your friend,

370
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,012
we're building a model
of your dead friend's head.

371
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,972
Twisted web.

372
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,474
So this is Max, huh?

373
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,644
And, uh, what's her name?
Laura.

374
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,814
Those were the good years,
the early years.

375
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,482
What happened? Why did you stop
working with them?

376
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,942
Pair of monsters
or what?

377
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,486
No, it wasn't that.

378
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,613
Well, what was it?

379
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,410
It was my fault.

380
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,539
It was supposed to be
my big debut as a director.

381
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,584
Creature feature,
"Black Lagoon"-style.

382
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:36,087
And we had a terrific
young actress,

383
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,922
Lily Albern.

384
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,763
She died on the set.

385
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,561
And, and it all died
that day.

386
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,315
Christ, Arthur, fuck.

387
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,984
It was an accident.

388
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,289
We were shooting a scene
where she went underwater

389
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,750
and the sea monster
attacked her.

390
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,046
We had a big tank set up
with an emergency system.

391
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,173
If she had an issue
in the tank,

392
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,758
she would hit a button

393
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,344
and this red
emergency light bulb

394
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,012
would go off,

395
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,682
and we'd cut
and pull her out.

396
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,684
Eyebrows.

397
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,478
It was a crazy day.

398
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,772
We were running behind,

399
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,025
and Lily was having
trouble in the tank.

400
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,445
She'd go in, and the red light
would go on.

401
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,032
We would cut
and pull her out.

402
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,159
Over and over again.

403
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,370
I got frustrated.

404
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,372
Everybody was.

405
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,500
And then on the last take,

406
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,168
everything went perfect.

407
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,254
The sea monster attacked her.

408
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,881
She thrashed.
She struggled.

409
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,550
We got it.

410
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,636
So we were elated.

411
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,555
But...

412
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,600
she wasn't moving.

413
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,438
And when we pulled her
out of the tank...

414
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,401
she was dead.

415
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,697
Fuck.

416
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,366
Why didn't she, uh,
set off the red light bulb?

417
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,409
Arthur:
I don't know.

418
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,829
I, I, I can't believe
that it was

419
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,416
because I was frustrated
with her

420
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,419
and she didn't want
to let me down.

421
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,589
But...

422
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,717
I do believe that.

423
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,432
I believe that...

424
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,018
I killed her.

425
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,440
So that's why you
walked away from all this?

426
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,150
You better believe it.

427
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,323
I, uh,
I lost a friend.

428
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,451
She was my best friend,
uh, Natalie.

429
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,829
And, uh, you know, I wonder
if I could have saved her,

430
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,956
but I didn't.

431
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,836
And so
I walked away too.

432
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,964
You know, I keep thinking
it's behind me, right?

433
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,884
But then I keep just, like,
playing it back out again,

434
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,011
trying to,
trying to make it right,

435
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,179
trying to change it.

436
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,139
I don't know.

437
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,767
I mean,
does it ever end?

438
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,104
Do I believe that
the dead can forgive us?

439
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,899
No, I don't believe that.

440
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,901
Bullshit.

441
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,278
-What?
-I mean, if you didn't think

442
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,530
the dead could forgive us,

443
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,281
you wouldn't be making
your whole movie,

444
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,409
the, uh,
"The Orpheus Syndrome."

445
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,160
I mean, that's what
it's all about.

446
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,205
Bringing the past back to life
like a ritual of penitence.

447
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,498
Arthur:
Ritual of penitence?

448
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,417
Who appointed you Pope?

449
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,377
I was recently anointed.
Thank you.

450
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,171
I, uh... come on, man.
Cut the shit.

451
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,881
I mean, you got Orpheus

452
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,134
who's going
through film gates

453
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,553
into the underworld,
which looks like a water tank

454
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,014
to bring a girl
back from the dead.

455
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,016
The guy's got
a movie camera for a face.

456
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,351
The other guy,
that Cyclops monster,

457
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,229
he's got a red
light bulb for an eye.

458
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,440
I mean, I'm not judging.

459
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,775
Just, you know,
it all makes sense.

460
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,903
You got to revisit the past
to get past it, huh?

461
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,239
You think that's true?

462
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:35,035
Hey, dominae vomingus dingus.

463
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,121
I'm gonna make
some Hot Pockets.

464
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,664
-You want some?
-Yeah.

465
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,041
Alright, Arthur.

466
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,421
-It's cool.
-Yeah?

467
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,672
Yeah.

468
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,521
(phone ringing)

469
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,858
(mumbling)

470
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,865
LAM Archives.

471
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,951
They still got you
in the basement, huh?

472
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,661
(Raoul laughs)

473
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,913
Arthur.

474
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,122
Haven't heard
your voice

475
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,874
in such a long time.

476
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,834
How are you, my friend?

477
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,169
Arthur:
Uh, I'm fine.

478
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,004
I need you to do a favor.

479
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,216
I need you to pull
some footage for me.

480
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:35,637
Reel numbers 1-6-6-3-2-3-4

481
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,891
through 1-6-6-3-2-4-6.

482
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:46,022
That was everything
on April the 12th, 1989.

483
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,610
Are you sure?

484
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,154
-That's, um...
-Arthur: I know.

485
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,824
I know what's on there.

486
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,576
I'm not supposed
to check anything out.

487
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,371
But that's okay, buddy.

488
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,707
Um...

489
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:07,460
Max was digitizing everything
for the 40th anniversary.

490
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,587
He got through that pile
of stuff already.

491
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,715
Nobody's going to miss it.

492
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,049
Thank you, old friend.

493
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,051
Raoul: I'll bring 'em
over tomorrow.

494
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,094
Yeah.

495
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,567
Hey, I'm Raoul.

496
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:34,446
Um, I'm here to deliver
some film to Arthur.

497
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,947
Is he around?

498
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,365
That's terrific.
He's inside.

499
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,742
I'm, uh, I'm Charlie,

his, uh, assistant
and head deliverer.

501
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,580
You're the head
of delivery.

502
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,832
No, I, uh,
I deliver heads.

503
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,251
-Alright.
-Alright. Cool.

504
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,461
Yeah, he's right in there.

505
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,421
Okay. Thank you.

506
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,173
I like your car.

507
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,174
I like the Honda.

508
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,134
It's my mother's car.
It's okay.

509
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,060
Ah geez.
Nice patch of concrete

510
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,145
too much to ask for,
I guess.

Are you fucking
kidding me?

-Young Arthur: You can do this.

517

We need you
to do this, honey.

518
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,276
This is what
you're being paid for.

I don't have any of it.
I checked it out.

00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,233
Arthur has it.

542
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,111
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
call him right now,

543
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,278
and I'm going
to go over there,

544
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,488
-and I'm going to...
-(doorbell rings)

545
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,323
Raoul:
...to go get it for you.

546
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,538
Don't worry
about it, Raoul.

547
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,665
Forget I ever called.

548
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,917
Raoul: Please,
don't be mad at me.

549
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,442
I've spent
my whole life thinking

550
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,318
that I killed that girl.

551
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,822
I'm sorry.

552
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,617
If I had thought...

553
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,203
I never would have.
I'd never.

554
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,082
I thought she was being...

555
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,919
I don't even know,
an actress,

556
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,464
a silly actress.

557
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,966
And we had put everything
into that production.

558
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,470
Our houses.
All of us.

559
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,181
And we were bleeding money.
I shielded you, too.

560
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,391
You didn't even know
how in the hole we were,

561
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,185
every day we went over.

562
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,481
Arthur,
it was an accident.

563
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:24,361
Raoul said that
Max had digitized

564
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,987
these reels.

565
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,323
Did Max see this?

566
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,577
Did he tell you
he saw it?

567
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,165
I am so sorry

568
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:40,585
that you held this
for all these years.

569
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,631
But I did, too.

570
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,716
I did it and I held it

571
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,928
so you boy geniuses
could make your monsters

572
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:53,932
and not have to wonder
what it all cost.

573
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:57,310
I was doing the dirty work,
always, for both of you.

574
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,354
And you can pretend
that you didn't see it,

575
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,981
but don't you fucking
judge me for it.

576
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,026
I move forward.
Always forward.

577
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,488
And I am not going
to lose what I built.

578
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,327
And you're right that the dead
can't forgive me...

579
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,581
but they also
can't hurt me.

580
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,546
Laura, let me ask you this.

581
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:30,218
Did you have anything
to do with Max's death?

582
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,598
He jumped
right in front of me,

583
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,684
like he wanted
to punish me.

584
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,104
My hand to God.

585
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:50,447
No one will see
this footage.

586
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,420
Thank you.

587
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,219
Arthur, I am so sorry.

588
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,243
(sighs)

589
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:42,123
(laughs)

590
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,001
Oh.

591
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:57,180
(tires squealing)

592
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,708
Oh, he wouldn't.

593
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,464
Charlie:
Arthur!

594
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,050
Arthur. Arthur.

595
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,471
Woman: (over phone) Stay calm, ma'am.
The police will be there shortly.

596
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,223
Can I get your name
and information?

597
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,518
Would you just,
just send somebody quick?

598
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,519
Okay? Please.

599
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,229
Shit.

600
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,858
Arthur, man.

601
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,693
I'm sorry,
I gotta go, okay.

602
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,403
Alright.

603
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,365
What the fuck?

604
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,583
(engine starts)

605
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,138
Laura:
Oh, his heart was always...

606
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:23,183
He always had trouble
with his heart.

607
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,518
I'm just happy
he didn't suffer.

608
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,689
I'm calling with
a legal question.

609
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,566
LAM funded Arthur's work.

610
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:34,152
I'm, I'm wondering
when we can get possession

611
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,445
of his workshop.

612
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,698
Well, today, if we can.

613
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:41,159
I'd like to see what's there
and pull some pieces

614
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,162
for our 40th anniversary
celebration tonight.

615
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,122
As a tribute.

616
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:51,711
Okay.

617
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,381
Uh-huh.

618
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,676
Uh-huh.

619
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,137
Okay. Well, work at it
and call me back.

620
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,239
Excuse me.

621
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,159
-Charlie: Hi.
-May I help you?

622
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,411
Charlie:
I was, uh...

623
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,579
Hi.

624
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:27,706
Laura, right?

625
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:32,127
I'm Charlie.
I was, uh...

626
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,130
I was Arthur's assistant.
I dropped off the head.

627
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,673
Right.

628
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:38,925
How may I help you?

629
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,677
Uh...

630
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,596
Well, gee, this is,
this is sort of weird.

631
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,099
I thought I'd know how
to put it when I got here,

632
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,353
but it was so sudden,
his death.

633
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:53,523
And, uh, well, I'd gotten
kind of close to him.

634
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,901
Like, I really cared
about the guy.

635
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:57,861
Anyway...

636
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,072
he never left the house.

637
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,451
Like, literally
never went anywhere.

638
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,703
But I think

639
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,165
maybe the day he died,
he came to see you.

640
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,126
Ah, gosh,
I, I'm sorry.

641
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,045
You know what?
I feel really intrusive here.

642
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,088
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

643
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,673
I shouldn't have come.

644
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,133
I'm sorry.

645
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,303
No, I get it.
It's, it's alright.

646
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,514
Why don't you come inside?

647
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,476
-Thanks.
-Laura: My mother had

648
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,186
a framed
embroidery thing

649
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,479
over our commode
growing up

650
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,273
that said
"Strange Blessings."

651
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:37,817
And that's what yesterday
made me think of.

652
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,027
I didn't expect him,

653
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,529
and he just showed up
out of the blue.

654
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:43,615
And I'm so glad he did,

655
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,868
that I, I got to say
goodbye to him,

656
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,453
see him one last time.

657
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,789
Strange blessings.

658
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,833
God. But he wanted
to talk about the past.

659
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,211
About Max.
All of it.

660
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,507
I'm sorry.
And if I'm overstepping, please.

661
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:03,885
But, uh, do you feel
like in talking

662
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,513
and whatever you guys said,

663
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:10,350
that maybe he reconciled
his guilt?

664
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,521
Look, I don't know
what I'm asking. I...

665
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,273
Maybe I just want to know

666
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,234
if he got some peace
in the end.

667
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:21,194
Peace?

668
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,821
I don't know.

669
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:26,449
Peace, that's, that's
many different things,

670
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,702
but I, I think...

671
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,289
No. I know that he was,

672
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,125
he was able to let go

673
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,503
of blaming himself
for Lily's death.

674
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:40,922
Does that help you?

675
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:44,092
Oh yeah. That's...

676
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,218
that's, wow.

677
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:48,346
That's, uh, albatross.

678
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,724
Over here.
Thank you. I, uh...

679
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,227
Geez. Uh, thanks.

680
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:55,729
(scoffs) I...

681
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,313
And look, uh,

682
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,774
I'm sorry to show up
and bother you.

683
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,570
No. It feels good to give
someone else some comfort.

684
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,781
Arthur gave me that too
with his maquettes

685
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,742
and our conversation.

686
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:09,993
That's great.

687
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,912
Yeah, it really did help me.

688
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,458
Yeah. Well, I bet. I bet.
How could it not?

689
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,960
Oh.

690
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,503
Helped me to say
goodbye to him

691
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,172
and feel
some kind of release

692
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,300
that I wasn't responsible
for Max's death.

693
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,304
Uh, thank you so much
for coming by.

694
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,307
It's really great to meet you.
Take care, Charlie.

695
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:35,977
Charlie:
Uh...

696
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,941
You said
you weren't responsible?

697
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:44,527
What?

698
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:47,113
Uh, could you repeat
what you said before.

699
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:49,324
I think
my hearing is going.

700
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:53,119
That I wasn't responsible
for Max's death?

701
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,997
And that like Arthur
had to let go,

702
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:57,999
I have to do the same.

703
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,460
Max's death wasn't
my fault.

704
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,463
And Arthur's heart problem
just caught up with him.

705
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,840
Neither were a result
of my actions.

706
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:07,842
I didn't kill them.

707
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,764
Are you okay?

708
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:17,602
Yeah.

709
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,229
Well, goodbye, Charlie.

710
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,356
I hope I've given you
some peace.

711
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:26,820
(sighs)

712
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,075
What?

713
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,667
Hey, Head Delivery.

714
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,586
No, she killed both of them,
okay. She basically told me.

715
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:45,380
Not even basically,
she just told me.

716
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,840
I mean, not directly,
but, you know,

717
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,675
she was lying,
and I could tell she was lying, so.

718
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,760
What is this,

721

but I can detect lies.

Wait, what are you
doing here?

723
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:01,312
Oh, Arthur, he checked out
some film,

724
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,565
and then Laura
requested the same reel,

725
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,734
so I'm in some deep shit.

726
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,694
-And I gotta get it back.
-What?

727
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,362
Yeah, I know.
Weird coincidence.

728
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,490
I mean, nobody's looked
at this stuff for years.

729
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,451
Coincidence, my foot.

730
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,785
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

731
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:17,579
You dropped
the film off to Arthur.

732
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,372
I went to drop
the head off to Laura.

733
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:20,874
He was watching the film.

734
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,335
Then when I got back from Laura's,
he had gone there.

735
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,670
So whatever he saw
on that film

736
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,380
made him go
to Laura's, yeah?

737
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,757
Okay.

739
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,011
It's behind the scenes
of the "Dragonfish" set

the day Lily died.

741
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,514
-Oh shit.
-Yeah, I thought it was pretty dark.

742
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:37,557
He wanted to see it,

743
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:39,684
but he was going
through some shit.

744
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:42,854
Yeah. Got to face
the past to get past it.

Well, we got
to watch that stuff.

748
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,986
We got to see
what he saw.

749
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:51,154
How does this thing work?

750

Uh, let's, uh,

-Okay.

Hmm. That's weird.

762
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,686

for the reels

763
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:26,439
245 and 247 but no 246.

764
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,692
-Max.
-What?

765
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:31,569
So if Max had this
on his files,

766
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:33,071
you'd need his face, right?

767
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:36,241
Okay, so, Laura, used the maquette
to access the files

768
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:38,118
and, uh, delete it.

was on that reel of film.

00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,633
without Arthur
and Max by my side.

897
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:11,136
Charlie: Okay. It's now
or never, right?

898
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,887
-Raoul: Oh no. It's going to be now.
-Charlie: Okay.

899
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:15,598
Laura: I know that
if they were here tonight,

900
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,184
they would be so happy...

901
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,981
about what I have done

902
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:25,525
to keep this company alive.

903
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,822
Or at the very least,

904
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,365
they would understand.

905
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:38,621
I, I hope that they
would understand

906
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:40,457
why I did what I did.

907
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:46,880
Ooh.
(gasps)

908
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:50,383
(audience murmuring)

909
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:55,555
I'm sorry. I...

910
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:58,641
Very funny.

911
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,565
As we look back
on our history...

912
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,028
there are so many moments
to be proud of.

913
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:12,864
The--When Lily died

914
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,866
on the set of "Dragonfish,"

915
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:18,495
I thought it would
end us forever.

916
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:21,456
But... tonight,

917
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:24,042
we put the past behind us

918
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,585
once and for all!

919
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:28,588
(audience murmuring)

920
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,507
What I mean is

921
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,050
the past cannot...

922
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,095
-Charlie: Sorry.
-Raoul: Excuse me.

923
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:39,307
The past, uh, cannot...

924
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,559
hurt us.

925
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,560
I, um...

926
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,437
I'm, this is...

927
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:49,651
I have to go...

928
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:53,571
Just...

929
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:56,241
play it.

930
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,661

931
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,583

Narrator:
LAM began

934
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,261
as a humble
practical effects shop

935
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:19,681
conceived by three
Cal Arts animation students

936
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:22,100
in 1975.

937
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,979
Arthur, Max, and Laura
founded the company

938
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,856
on one simple idea,

939
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:31,401
that imagination
could be made real.

940
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:38,450
This collective
childhood love of monsters

941
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,910
is what inspired them
to build LAM.

942
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,621
Throughout the years,
this powerful trio

943
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:46,791
have set the standard
for monster creation.

944
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:49,377
And in order
to feel real,

945
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:50,628
it has to be real.

946
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,717
We see, uh, creation
of life from clay

947
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,260
not only in the Bible,

948
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,056
but in every ancient mythology
around the world.

949
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:03,808
When I'm in my studio...

950
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:05,727
(projector clicking)

951
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:08,188
...I am bringing
things to life.

952
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:12,650
And there's just
no other feeling--

953
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,402
Laura:
Stop it! Shut it off.

954
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:15,862
-(audience murmuring)
-Young Arthur: You feel like...

955
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,238
Shut it off!

956
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:18,531
Young Arthur:
...you're divine.

(audience murmuring)

958
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:33,380
Shut it off.
Shut it off.

959
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,592
Stop it!

960
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:39,427
Stop it!

961
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:47,644

Look into my eyes, Laura.

970

Remember this.
